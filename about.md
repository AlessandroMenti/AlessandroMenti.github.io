---
I earned my MSc degree in [Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.di.univr.it/) from the [University of Verona](http://www.univr.it/) (Italy).

<h2>Academia</h2>
My academic interests lie mainly in the areas of computer security and formal methods. You can find my publications (with preprints, where available), as well as some extra material, on the [Academia](/academia/) page.

<h2>Open source work</h2>
<h3>Projects</h3>
I have (slowly) started contributing to [FlightGear](http://www.flightgear.org/), a free and open source flight simulator.

<h3>Translations</h3>
I have contributed (in whole or in part) to Italian translations for several software packages, including:

* [Amaze File Manager](https://github.com/arpitkh96/AmazeFileManager), an Android file manager app
* [BootRacer](http://www.greatis.com/bootracer/), a utility for measuring the boot time of a PC
* [ChompSMS](http://www.chompsms.com/), an Android messaging app
* [GreaseMonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/), the popular user script engine for the Mozilla Firefox browser
* [Links](http://links.twibright.com/), a textual Web browser *(the updated translation was sent to the software developers; I'm waiting for it to be applied)*
* [ReText](https://github.com/retext-project/retext), a Markdown/reStructuredText editor
* [Review Board](https://www.reviewboard.org/), a Web-based code review tool
* [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
* [The Bug Genie](http://www.thebuggenie.com/), a bug tracking system

<h2>Contact me</h2>
You can contact me per e-mail at the following address (obfuscated to avoid spambots):
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>name</em> dot <em>surname</em> at <em>this domain</em></p>

(Please use an appropriate e-mail subject and avoid sending big attachments without prior notice).

I *strongly recommend* using encrypted e-mail for privacy: [you can find my GPG key here](/downloads/pubkey.asc) or get it from all major key servers, e.g. [the SKS keyservers pool](https://sks-keyservers.net). Its fingerprint is <code>95B6 E1C2 099E DC88 4C99  8360 8CEF F2C1 E975 87C2</code>.

<h3>Comments on blog posts</h3>
*This site does not have commenting functionality built in*. This stems mainly from my decision &mdash; matured after several years &mdash; to abandon <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>s and switch to a [static page generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the right reasons:

1. The only advantage CMSs bring to me is comment management. Everything else can be done just using pure HTML and (at most) a couple of scripts.
2. I strive to maintain this site [accessible](http://www.w3.org/WAI/), [minimal](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) and fast. CMSs don't give me much fine-grained control over the generated markup easily.
3. I dislike using third-party comment management tools due to privacy concerns. Moreover, privacy policies do not always give me all details [I should be able to give](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home_en/italian-legislation) regarding the processing of personal data, especially with regard to [cookie use](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/doc.jsp?ID=3167654) &mdash; not to mention [user profiling](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/doc.jsp?ID=1636001) and [data transfers to the United States](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/doc.jsp?ID=4472540).
